# Lumen v0.0 Scope

## Goal

Serve a browser-runnable ESM application from source files **without bundling**.

If this goal is met, v0.0 is complete.

---

## Included

- HTTP dev server written in Go
- Serve `index.html`
- Serve `.js` files as ES modules
- Support `<script type="module">`
- Rewrite bare imports to browser-resolvable paths
- Resolve and serve modules from `node_modules`
- Minimal in-memory caching
- Single command: `lumen dev`

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- File watching or auto reload
- TypeScript / JSX
- CSS handling
- Plugin system
- Production build output

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- No bundler involved
- Browser loads modules natively
- App runs using ESM imports
